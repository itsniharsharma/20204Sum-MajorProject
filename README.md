# 2024Sum-MajorProject

Software Description: <br><br>
So, initiating the description, This app is simple demonstration of Socket.io
application. I choose this as my Major project for summers, but it ended up in
a Day:). Websites we browse have an HTTP protocole,
which only allows a one way communication, being a client you search someting
on your browser, actually you are requesting something from server, inresponse
Server send you the requested data packets. This is a one way process. Now to
establish a two way connection, between client and server, web sockets are used.
They work on a principle called HTTP long polling, which means a 2 way connection,
where server interacts with client. Many clients joint to same server to interact.
This draws a framework of chat application. <br><br>
