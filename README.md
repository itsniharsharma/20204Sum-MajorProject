# 2024Sum-MajorProject

Software Description:

This application serves as a straightforward demonstration of a Socket.io implementation. Initially chosen as my major project for the summer, it evolved into something I was able to complete in just a day. Typically, websites we interact with rely on the HTTP protocol, which supports one-way communication. As a user, when you search for something on your browser, you are essentially sending a request to the server, and in response, the server sends back the requested data. This process is linear, with no ongoing interaction.

To enable two-way communication between the client and server, WebSockets are employed. WebSockets work on the principle of HTTP long polling, allowing for persistent, bidirectional communication. This enables the server to interact with the client in real time, facilitating dynamic data exchanges. In this setup, multiple clients can connect to the same server, further enhancing the potential for interactive applications, such as a chat system.
